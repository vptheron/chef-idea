idea CHANGELOG
==============

This file is used to list changes made in each version of the idea cookbook.

0.2.2
-----
- Kevin Mellott - Upgraded to install the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA Community (14.1.3) by default. Incorporated the usage of the Ark cookbook to simplify the installation process.
 Removed the 'user' and 'group' variables, to allow the installation to take place as the default "vagrant" user instead. Removed the "setup_dir" and "ide_dir" variables, and
 added a desktop entry file. This allows the program to appear in the "Applications" list; tested with Fedora 21.
